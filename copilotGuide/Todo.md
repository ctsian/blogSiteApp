Following change needed
- if im the loggedin user and if i see my profile then i should see follow button.
- the tabbed view is little odd and the hamburger gradient doesnt go very ui friendly make it subtle
- add a hint for the hamburger menu's existance
- if i go into tabs like feature or my blog but dont have any blog the ui is showing no articles yet but im struck and i couldnt navigate out of it as we are loading the no article if length empty on same /blogs endpoint and clicking home is not refreshing leaving me struck on the page. this needs to be fixed. 
- in the trending page implement a search, search bar is placed above the Trending screen title with some placehholder and users can enter some tags, title or authors and once entered a new search result page is displayed with relevant search results.
